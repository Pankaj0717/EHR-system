🏥 HealthVault – Your Daily Healthcare CompanionTransforming medical record storage into intelligent, everyday healthcare management for patients and caregivers.🎯 The Problem We're SolvingMeet Asha. She manages her own health AND her father's long-term medications. She faces:

💊 Medication chaos – Multiple prescriptions, missed doses, forgotten refills
